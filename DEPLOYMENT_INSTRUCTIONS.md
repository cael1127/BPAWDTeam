## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem:** Backend shows "Application failed to respond"
- **Solution:** Check Render logs, might be startup delay (free tier)
- **Fix:** Visit backend URL to wake it up

**Problem:** CORS errors in browser
- **Solution:** 
  1. Check FRONTEND_URL in Render environment variables
  2. Make sure it matches your Netlify URL exactly
  3. Redeploy backend after changing

**Problem:** API endpoints return 404
- **Solution:** Check backend logs in Render dashboard
- **Fix:** Ensure routes are properly defined in server.js

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** "API Base URL: undefined"
- **Solution:** Environment variable not set
- **Fix:** Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Netlify environment variables

**Problem:** Build fails on Netlify
- **Solution:** Check build logs
- **Common fixes:**
  - Run `npm install` locally to update package-lock.json
  - Ensure no errors in code
  - Check Node version compatibility

**Problem:** Site loads but features don't work
- **Solution:** Open browser console (F12)
- **Check:** Network tab for failed API calls
- **Fix:** Verify backend is running and CORS is configured

### Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://mindwell-backend.onrender.com/api/health

# Test CORS (from terminal)
curl -H "Origin: https://mindwell-campaign.netlify.app" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://mindwell-backend.onrender.com/api/appointments

# Check Netlify build logs
netlify logs

# Check Render logs (in Render dashboard)
```

## Keeping Backend Awake During Competition

### Option 1: UptimeRobot (Recommended)

2. Create monitor:
   - URL: `https://mindwell-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Interval: 5 minutes
   - Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
3. Backend stays awake during competition hours

### Option 2: Manual Wake-Up

Before your presentation (2-3 minutes):
1. Open: `https://mindwell-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
2. Wait for response
3. Backend is now warm and fast

## Post-Deployment Updates

To update your site after deployment:

```bash
# Make changes to code
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update website features"
git push

# Netlify auto-deploys on push to main
# Render auto-deploys on push to main
```

Both services redeploy automatically in 2-3 minutes.
